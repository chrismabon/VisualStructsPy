@package VisualStructsPy
Graphically displays data structures such as arrays, lists, and trees.

Users simply pass a list of data elements to the appropriate constructor function to instantiate and
populate a structure with that data. Note that trees have additional arguments to determine the manner
in which nodes are added.
